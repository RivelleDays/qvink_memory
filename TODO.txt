- Figure out how to limit the number of messages injected into the prompt so they can be replaced by the summaries.
- Add a button to transfer all summaries into a lorebook entry (not just the injected ones).
- Show the summaries in small text below each message? Then I wouldn't need to have the memory display at all.
- Add a dashed line at long-term limit, add a distinguishing label to rememberd messages that are out of the long-term limit.
- Message context menu option to mark as remembered
- Display of progress when summarizing?
- Include a few previous messages (or summaries) in the summary prompt, and specify that it should only include NEW events? This could aid in consistency and avoid duplicate info.
- Include an option to include just the user's last message in the summary prompt as well, instead of giving it its own summary?
