- Need to handle swiping.
- Add a dashed line at long-term limit?
- Message context menu option to mark as remembered
- Display of progress when summarizing?
- Include a few previous messages in the summary prompt, and specify that it should only include NEW events? (avoid diplicates?)
- Include an option to include just the user's last message in the summary prompt as well, instead of giving it its own summary?
